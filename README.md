Here you can see the projects I did during a 6,5h HTML/CSS course on youtube.
As a mainly C type of guy this was my first experience with webdevelopment but it was really fun and I'm interested in further webdev courses.
I can recommend the course and if you already have some basic programming experience it won't be hard.
